## Features

### Rate Changer
Create rate-modified versions of any beatmap instantly. Supports both single rates and bulk generation (e.g., 0.8x to 1.3x in one click). Perfect for practicing difficult sections at lower speeds or challenging yourself with faster versions.

### Skills Analysis
Visualize your improvement over time with detailed skill trend graphs. The analyzer tracks your performance across different skillsets and difficulty levels, showing you exactly where you excel and where you might need more practice.

### Session Tracker
Monitor your practice sessions in real-time. Companella automatically detects completed plays and records accuracy, difficulty ratings, and more. Review your session history to see how your performance evolves throughout each practice session.

### Smart Map Recommendations
Get personalized beatmap recommendations based on your current skill level. Choose from different focus modes:
- **Push** - Maps slightly above your comfort zone to help you improve
- **Consistency** - Maps at your level to build reliable accuracy
- **Deficit Fixing** - Maps targeting your weaker skillsets
- **Skillset Focus** - Practice specific patterns or techniques

### Session Planner
Plan your practice sessions effectively. Set goals and let Companella help you structure your practice time for maximum improvement.

### Overlay Mode
Companella automatically attaches to your osu! window as a companion overlay. It stays visible while you play and hides when you switch to other applications. Toggle visibility with a (not yet but soon) customizable hotkey (ALT+Q for now).

### Beatmap Detection
Automatically detects the beatmap you're viewing or playing in osu!. No need to manually drag and drop files - just open a map in osu! and Companella picks it up.

### Mapping Tools
Tools for beatmap creators:
- **BPM Analysis** - Automatically analyze and generate timing points from audio
- **SV Normalization** - Normalize scroll velocity across BPM changes
- **Offset Adjustment** - Quickly apply timing offsets to all timing points

### Auto-Updates
Companella checks for updates automatically and notifies you when a new version is available.
